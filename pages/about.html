	<p id="researchHeader">Research Interests</p>
	<p id="researchInterests">Surabhi's dissertation examines the nature of rurality as an identity as represented in American literature from 1920 to 2020, the United Statesâ€™ first century as a majority-urban country. Relying on comparative ethnic studies and ecocritical approaches, Surabhi argues that rurality cannot be cleanly defined and rather must be negotiated in combination with other, especially racial and ethnic, identities, as well as in relationship with physical environments. Surabhi also has a keen interest in questions of allyship, accountability, and racial solidarity, and, with Jeremy Glover, has received grant funding to pursue a joint book project on these topics.
