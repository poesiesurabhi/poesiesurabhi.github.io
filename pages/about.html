	<p id="researchHeader">Research Interests</p>
	<p id="researchInterests">Surabhi's dissertation, <i>Rewriting Rural America: Race, Environment, and Identity, 1920-2020,</i> posits rurality as a environmentally and socially negotiated identity rather than a measurable characteristic of a place. Working against popular stereotypes—political conservatism, uniform whiteness, unpopulated fields and decaying barns—and strictly policy-based definitions of rurality, it instead prioritizes a comparative ethnic studies approach, considering the rich literary output on rural people of color as well as race’s role in shaping rurality, and vice versa. Surabhi also has a keen interest in questions of allyship, accountability, and racial solidarity. Future project interests include Asian Americans’ relationship to settler colonialism and literary representations of interstate highways.
